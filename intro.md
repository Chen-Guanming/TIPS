## Introduction

   Recent advances in bioinformatics analyses have led to the development of novel tools enabling trajectory mapping of multi-parameter cellular data. However, assessing the contribution of unique biological pathways and transcription factors to an overall trajectory remains challenging. In this manuscript, we present a simplified approach for trajectory inference of pathway significance (TIPS) that leverages existing knowledgebases of functional pathways and transcription factor targets to enable discovery of the contributors most tightly correlated with a given pseudotime trajectory. Application of TIPS to bulk RNAseq data from TCGA hepatocellular carcinoma cohort permits the easy recovery of pathway signatures associated with immune-permissive tumors, and these signatures could also be clearly recapitulated through concurrent evaluation of single-cell profiles of tumor cells and tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes. The entire TIPS package can be run through a user-friendly GUI, and may serve as a useful tool to help biologists perform deeper functional analyses and visualizations of their single-cell and large cohort RNAseq data.
